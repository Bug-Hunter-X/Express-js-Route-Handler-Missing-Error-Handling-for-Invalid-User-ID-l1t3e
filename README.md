# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of error handling for invalid input parameters.  The example shows a route that retrieves a user by ID.  If the ID is not a valid integer, the application will crash or produce unexpected results.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with proper error handling.

## Bug

The main issue is the missing check for whether `req.params.id` is a valid integer before attempting to parse it.  This can lead to `NaN` being used in the comparison, resulting in incorrect results or errors.

## Solution

The solution involves adding input validation to check if `req.params.id` can be parsed as an integer.  If it can't, a suitable error response is returned.  This prevents unexpected behavior and improves the application's robustness.
